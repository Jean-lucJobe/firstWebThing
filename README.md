My first attempt at a web-page

So I recently acquired some skills in web-development and this seemed to be one way to show off that i'm capable of something.
All the files here contain stuff I coded myself. Regarding any files required, that I didn't create, there'll be a link to them at the end of this document.

There's an index page with a short (and unserious) profile and two boxes containing a link to: a very unfinished example of a registration form, and the other:
a working word guessing game.

in the "css" folder, it also had "normalize.css" which can be found at https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css.
