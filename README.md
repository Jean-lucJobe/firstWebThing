My first attempt at a web-page

So I recently acquired some skills in web-development and this seemed to be one way to show off that i'm capable of something.
All the files here contain stuff I coded myself.

There's an index page with a short (and unserious) profile and two boxes containing a link to: a very unfinished example of a registration form (there's next to nothing there at the moment), and the other: a working word guessing game.
